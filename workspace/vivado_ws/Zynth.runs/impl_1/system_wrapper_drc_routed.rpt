Input pipelining  
DSP system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_1/r_Mult_reg input system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_1/r_Mult_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_2/r_Mult_reg input system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_2/r_Mult_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_2/r_Mult_reg input system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_2/r_Mult_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#6 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_3/r_Mult_reg input system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_3/r_Mult_reg/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#7 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_3/r_Mult_reg input system_i/Note_Generator_0/U0/DDS_3/r_Mult_reg/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP system_i/NCA_0/U0/DDS_0/U0/r_Mult_reg multiplier stage system_i/NCA_0/U0/DDS_0/U0/r_Mult_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net system_i/NCA_0/U0/ADSR_Envelope_0/U0/w_Scalar__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin system_i/NCA_0/U0/ADSR_Envelope_0/U0/w_Scalar_reg[23]_i_2/O, cell system_i/NCA_0/U0/ADSR_Envelope_0/U0/w_Scalar_reg[23]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
